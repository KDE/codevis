Codevis is an analysis and visualization tool designed to assist in code maintenance for C++ codebases.

The tool provides a graph representation of C++ source code and its external dependencies.
It is aimed at developers working primarily with large codebases, who would benefit from being able to visualise
source code in order to effectively understand it and its dependencies, for debugging their code or reviewing others' work.

This tool was developed by Codethink as part of a project sponsored by Bloomberg.
The tool is based on John Lakos' ideas, which can be found in his books ("[Large Scale C++ Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Software-Design-John-Lakos/dp/0201633620/)"
and "[Large Scale C++ Volume 1: Process and Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0201717069/)"),
as a means of displaying logical and physical entities.
