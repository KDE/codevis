# Security Issue Reporting

If you believe you have identified a security vulnerability in this project, you may submit a private vulnerability disclosure.

Please do NOT open an issue in the GitHub repository, as we'd prefer to keep vulnerability reports private until
we've had an opportunity to review and address them.

If you have any questions or concerns, please send an email to one of the maintainers.
