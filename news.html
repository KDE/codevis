# What Codevis Is

## Codevis Understands your Data
Codevis is a framework for code knowledge, offering a small suite of tools to
gather information about source code and it's genertaed artefacts, presenting
to the user in a way that he can analise and spot potential problems.

## Codevis is a Workbench for Analysis
Codevis is also a way to document your codebase in a visual way, which is
suitable to trainings, by scanning the source code and presenting the results
as a graph, the developer or the analyst can understand an architecture faster
than if he had to open file to file and jump through hoops.

## Codevis is an Audit Tool
Codevis is also a security audit tool, because the data it holds about the
software being analyzed can show potential security issues that are better
represented as graphs, such as:
    - If there is a CVE on the code, what parts of the code are affected by it?
    - If this developer leaves the company, how much of the code will become
unatended?

## Codevis can be used in ways we have not tought of
Codevis helps in the following areas:
    - Code Knowledge
    - Security Audits
    - Architectural Analysis
    - And maybe more

Because `Codevis` at it's core is just a frontend to plugins, each plugin can
analyze it's internal data in any way possible, creating oportunities for
organizations to leverage it's data in any way the analyst seems fit.
